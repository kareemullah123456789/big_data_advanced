This is the **Completed Jobs** detail view showing all 9 jobs from your persist/unpersist demo. Let me break down what this reveals about the performance differences:

## ðŸ“Š **Job Analysis - Persist vs Non-Persist Performance**

### ðŸ”´ **Jobs 1-4: WITHOUT PERSIST** (higher durations)
- **Job 1**: 0.7s - First count operation
- **Job 2**: 0.7s - Second count (recomputed from scratch)
- **Job 3**: 0.7s - Filter + count (full recomputation)
- **Job 4**: 6s - GroupBy + sum (most expensive, full recomputation)

### ðŸŸ¢ **Jobs 5-8: WITH PERSIST** (lower durations)
- **Job 5**: 2s - First count (includes caching overhead)
- **Job 6**: 0.1s - Second count (âš¡ **7x faster** - uses cache!)
- **Job 7**: 0.3s - Filter + count (âš¡ **2.3x faster** - uses cache!)
- **Job 8**: 4s - GroupBy + sum (âš¡ **1.5x faster** - uses cache!)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Observations**

### **Duration Patterns**:
- **Without persist**: Consistent 0.7s for simple ops, 6s for complex
- **With persist**: First operation slower (caching), subsequent ops much faster

### **Stages & Tasks**:
- **Jobs 4 & 8** (GroupBy operations): 3/3 stages, 203/203 tasks (most complex)
- **Other jobs**: 2/2 stages, 3/3 tasks (simpler operations)

### **Performance Gains**:
- **Job 6 vs Job 2**: Count operation **7x faster** with cache
- **Job 7 vs Job 3**: Filter operation **2.3x faster** with cache
- **Job 8 vs Job 4**: GroupBy operation **1.5x faster** with cache

## ðŸ’¡ **What This Demonstrates**

### **Caching Overhead**:
Job 5 (2s) took longer than Job 1 (0.7s) because it had to:
1. Execute the operation
2. Store results in memory/disk

### **Cache Benefits**:
Jobs 6-8 show dramatic speedups because they:
1. Skip data loading and initial transformations
2. Read directly from cached data
3. Only execute the specific operation requested

## ðŸš€ **Real-World Impact**

This pattern shows why persist is crucial for:
- **Iterative algorithms** (ML training)
- **Interactive analytics** (multiple queries on same dataset)
- **ETL pipelines** (multiple transformations on same data)

The cache overhead pays off immediately after the first reuse, with exponential benefits for subsequent operations!
